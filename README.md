# Format Clock

This Gnome Shell extension allows to modify clock format on the top panel and
date format in calendar menu.

This extension is based on
[Change clock format] (https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/617/fixclock/)
extension, written by
[silvioricardoc] (https://extensions.gnome.org/accounts/profile/silvioricardoc).

## Installation

```sh
git clone https://github.com/eternal-sorrow/format-clock.git
cd format-clock
./autogen.sh
make
make install
```

If you want to uninstall the extension, type:

```sh
# From the root of the project directory
make uninstall
```
##Warning
**Not compatible with gnome-shell-3.14!**
Adding compatibility may be somewhat tricky and for now I don't have enough time
for that. Patches welcome :-)

## Seconds not ticking
If you have always :00 seconds in the clock, you should enable the
"clock-show-seconds" property in Top Panel tab in the gnome-tweak-tool or at the
path org.gnome.desktop.interface in dconf-editor.
